This app is a small server to serve as a GitHub Post-Receive hook to close tickets 
in GoPlan.

You need a goplan.yml file with your credentials. Looks like this:

--- 
:company_alias:
:consumer_key:
:consumer_secret:
:access_token:
:access_token_secret:

You can run goplan-auth to handle OAuth for you and create and populate this file.

This very simple hook looks for a pattern in commit messages:

		[Closes #ticket_number]

Current behavior closes the referred ticket and adds a comment like so:

		Closed.
		
		http://github.com/defunkt/github/commit/41a212ee83ca127e3c8cf465891ab7216a705f59


This project also requires the following rubygems:
- sinatra
- oauth
- json


TODO:
- refactor code so doesn't look like a hack
- cleanup, tests
- make use of goplan gem (when available) to extend functionality
