This app is a small server to act as a GitHub Post-Receive hook to close tickets 
in GoPlan projects.
http://goplanapp.com/

Hook will live at http://example.com/project_alias/github

I took inspiration from Github's own awsome Post-Receive service
http://github.com/pjhyett/github-services/

This very simple hook looks for a pattern in commit messages:

		[Closes #ticket_number]

Current behavior closes the referred ticket and adds a comment like so:

		Closed.
		
		http://github.com/defunkt/github/commit/41a212ee83ca127e3c8cf465891ab7216a705f59

GoPlan API uses OAuth to handle authentication.
Register an application with GoPlan to obtain consumer key and secret.
http://goplanapp.com/oauth_clients/new

Before deploying the app run goplan-auth to create a goplan.yml file with your credentials.

Template for goplan.yml file is as follows:
--- 
:company_alias:
:consumer_key:
:consumer_secret:
:access_token:
:access_token_secret:

It might look too much for just the given task, but I decided to take advantage of the
modular structure of github-services in case I wanted to add more web hooks to 
interact with other areas of GoPlan projects (Discussions, Tasks, Time Tracking),
and handling different kinds of payloads from different services.

You need:
- sinatra
- oauth
- json
